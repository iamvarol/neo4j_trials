2019-11-01,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,"I contacted Ally on Friday XX/XX/XXXX after falling behind on payments due to being out of work for a short period of time due to an illness. I chated with a representative after logging into my account regarding my opitions to ensure I protect my credit and bring my account current. 

She advised me that before an extenstion could be done, I had to make a payment in the amount of {$270.00}. I reviewed my finances, as I am playing catch up on all my bills and made this payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This rep advised me, once this payment posts to my account to contact Ally back for an extention or to have a payment deffered to the end of my loan. 

With this in mind, I contacted Ally again today and chatted with XXXX. I explained all of the above and the information I was provided when I chatted with the rep last week. She asked several questions and advised me that a one or two month  extension/deffered payment could be done however partial payment is needed! WHAT? She advised me {$230.00} or there abouts would be due within 10 days from me accepting the agreement and then the remaining bal of {$150.00} or there abouts would be due in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my payments of {$380.00} per month would resume. 

If this was the case, I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN OFFERED THIS WHEN I JUST MADE MY PAYMENT so that I could catch up on my bills. 

This company was working with XXXX in New Jersey which has since closed most likely due to illegal practices, they changed my loan company to this company after I had signed paperwork for another, kill you with interest rates and has NEVER once considered refiancing my vechile for a lower interest rate ( due to the age of the vechile other companies will not take it ) and THEY DO NOT WORK WITH YOU!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,ALLY FINANCIAL INC.,NJ,088XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-11-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3425257

XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected.

Our account was set up for autopay and we were unaware that the autopay had an expiration date. 
According to customer service, the autopay ended XX/XX/2018 so our XX/XX/2018 payment was delinquent. 
We use autopay for many accounts and the autopay is usually continuous for the life of the loan/account. 
We explained to their customer service department that we didnt receive any notices that our autopay was going to be ending soon or that it needed to be renewed. They said that they dont provide these types of notifications because it is the customer who sets up the autopay. 
We also explained to their customer service department that we never received any phone calls that we were past due on any payments. They explained that the collections department tried to contact one of the numbers on file and was told not to call that number again. On further review of the loan application, it appears they reached out to my husbands HR department at work which he placed on the lease application to verify employment. They said that eventhough they didnt try to reach out to our cellphones, they are not required to even call us. The call they made to my husbands HR department was just a courtesy call.

Funds from a FHA Disaster Partial Claim Modification ( to pay for  forebereance months ) have yet to been applied a year after signing documents. 

After Hurricane Irma ( XX/XX/XXXX ), Home Point Financial ( our mortgage bank ) offered a 3-month forbearance ( for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). In XX/XX/XXXX, we continued with our monthly payments until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted paperwork for an approved FHA Disaster Partial Claim modification that would cover payment for forbearance months + XX/XX/XXXX ( while the modification was setup and took place ) in the amount of {$10000.00}. We were instructed to resume payments in XX/XX/XXXX, and we have sent our monthly payment without failure to this date. 

However, as of today XX/XX/XXXX ( a year after we submitted documentation for the FHA Disaster Partial Claim modification ), the funds have not been applied to the account. In the bank system, we appear delinquent to the amount that equals this modification and regardless of our multiple attempts to call attention to the bank to review this anomaly, we have been told that their system is correct and that we must pay in full that amount. 

We sent a letter* dated XX/XX/XXXX to several offices of Home Point in multiple states with copies of all checks proof of our  regular payments. Should the FHA modification funds were applied, we would not be delinquent. We doubt they read our letter. On phone call in XX/XX/XXXX we were told that because of our delinquency our account was sent to legal department to initiate foreclosure proceedings. *letter attached to this claim. 

Checks with mortgage payments for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were returned ; we sent XXXX 's payment but won't be surprised that is also returned. At the moment our delinquency totals 7 months : 4 months covered by the FHA modification + XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. We have placed the funds for the returned checks aside so that when the bank starts accepting payments again, we will be able to submit. 

For months we have received calls from debt collectors, and experienced dismissives from multiple bank associates and managers - because in their records their files are accurate. They don't seem to realize the FHA modification funds are missing! 

We need help locating the FHA modification funds and having them properly accounted towards our account so that we can bring our loan account current, and stop the wrongful foreclosure proceedings.",,Home Point Financial Corporation,FL,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3282375

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a shock! The mortgage company neglected to put in the MUD taxes in the note resulting in a $ XX/XX/XXXX increase in payments. This was a deceptive practice because being a retired police officer, I would not have purchased this home.

How in the world can that happen. anyway in order not to lose my home, I borrowed the money off my credit card and paid the taxes on the house directly. I then asked the mortgage company to adjust my escrow for this year.

Now they are threatening me with foreclosure. When I sent in my payment of {$1800.00}, they applied it to the escrow without my permission. I have sent the mortgage payment the same way for the past year but in order to continue this unfair tactic, they applied it to escrow. I guess they make a lot of money off interest in escrow.

Learned tonight, after 3 hours waiting for Equifax to answer, I was advised there is an EXTENDED on my Equifax.

Now, apparently id theft has happened with Equifax. Someone submitted documents to Equifax. Now there is someone tampering with my Equifax report and that is identity theft.

I requested copies of the paperwork that was obtained to of made the alert possible.

I was told I am not allowed to have the information. I am completely locked out of my account and not able to monitor.

Equifax, is not working with me ; yet against me. Should not credit bureaus be working with victims of ID theft?

They made it difficult, and after 3 hours back to square one. Phone disconnected and none of my concerns or actions necessary to protect myself are possible.

I am concerned with the way they identified me. They asked questions that anyone could answer. Of course because someone used the info to add the extended.

I asked her to verify my calling me or texting. I feel safer and its a good tool. I was told they are unable to do that.

Equifax is part of the problem and if they dont cooperate ; what can I do? Submit a complaint to CFPB in which they never acknowledge any of my complaints.

Equifax needs to change their policies to ensure there are extra steps of getting a consumer verified other than asking questions, that someone has from ID theft.

The entire waste of time, without any resolution, and still locked out.

How do I get around this which, should not be difficult in the first place and what reasons are they unable to send a code to our phones and we verify.

The only option they offer, is an email to click a link and emails do not always get delivered quick. I was told to wait an hour, I accept that.

Why would they not take extra secure measures to verify my identity? It is already been established ; someone submitted a copy of my social security, proof of address, and other documents they require for an extended. Am I the XX/XX/XXXX consumer who finds many holes in this process that does nothing for protecting and verifying my identity.

SPS statements they mailed to me indicates that I owe XXXX XXXX dollars ( XXXX ) for property taxes, which is not true but they refused to tell me how they derived at that number. There are also charges that show XXXX charges for inspections with no details as to why, especially since I was not in foreclosure. I sent SPS a payment history to show that the billing was incorrect however they refused to stop the Auction of my home scheduled for XX/XX/2019. I filed a Notice of Error on XX/XX/2019 they have ignored the notice, even though they have opened an inquiry for research. They indicated they did not have to stop it because of the RESPA regulations did not apply to Dual Tracking for this incident. The notice of error stated numerous accounting errors by SPS, over charges and other erroneous charges from companies that I do not know that are on the SPS statement of charges sent out by the previous servicer and SPS. 

I also was charged for numerous inspections charges for my home when my home was not in foreclosure. I was charged BPO charges and legal fees when my account was in a current status. I am not sure of what the charges are that are on my account and why, but I asked that SPS give  an accounting to why they continued to charge those incorrect amounts to my mortgage account when I have indicated they were incorrect many times. They are currently ignoring my request. I requested that SPS review my account and make corrections to my interest and my principle, they have refused to this date to do that. 
SPS on XX/XX/XXXX received a QWR they have refused to respond to my request, they indicated they will respond to it after my home is auctioned off which does not make a lot of sense to me. SPS has given erroneous information about the status of my account, I was told by several managers especially one that opened the research to verify the accounting errors on my account that the auction of my home would be postponed until that happened. Of course that was lies. I have requested several call backs from supervisor in the department of the Ombudsman and litigations no one will return the call. I requested that other executives in SPS ( any department ) return the call and address my inquiries and there has been no response, no call back and no evidence that they are willing to allow a workout plan. This has been blatant bullying and harassment from SPS with refusal to discuss with me the status of my account. 

The interest on my account is incorrect because of the erroneous charges therefore the principle is incorrect I have as for a pay-off and settlement which they withdrew which was a breach of the prior agreement in place.

The following is my experience. I would not have received this kind of customer service at my other bank. 

I made several purchase from XXXX for the first time. I went to the bank to deposit an additional amount of money to account for the purchases. 

I was unware XXXX debited the account after hours for a purchase I believed I accounted for during reconciliation. 

U.S Bank normally debits the account immediately. XXXX debited the account after business hours and I was unable to deposit additional funds. I was unaware of this until I logged in. 

When I logged in, I saw an overdraft of {$36.00}. I called in to customer service to explain the situation and expected the {$36.00} to be refunded. 

I spoke to 'XXXX ID # XXXX. She put me on hold for several minutes. This was a simple housekeeping error. XXXX did not provide the 5 star customer service the bank advertises. After about 5 minutes, she stated she is unable to waive the fee. 

I was very unhappy and dissatisfied with the length of time it took for this minor housekeeping issue. I asked for her ID # and she would not provide it to me. I asked several times and she did not respond. 

I asked for a manager which took about another 5 minutes. XXXX ID # XXXX a a manager took over. She was unable to provide the 5 star customer service and stated she would not refund the {$36.00}. 

This bank chargers overdrafts in a manner that is excessive. This needs to be reviewed. They use the overdrafts as a way add to the earnings per share. 

This call I initiated should have been 5 minutes. Instead, US bank and its management use these situations to penalize their hard working customers. It is a very poor customer service tactic. 

US Bank does not care that I am a very dissatisfied regarding this conclusion. They are happy to charge me {$36.00}. 

I will be closing my accounts and using my other banking relationships.

2019-08-07,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,"","I have been working with NewRez for a while. They hold my current mortgage and, after negotiating, I was able to get them to agree to be competitive with other rates I was receiving. They started talking to me about the loan and I was very happy as it was going to save me 200-250/month and add very little to the loan. Eventually they were sending me LE and they were wildly inaccurate. They told me I simply needed to sign one and that they would get the correct numbers to me later. So I did. It took about 3 weeks for them to get me correct numbers and then they asked me to re-sign the original, incorrect LE. They said it was a technical glitch on their end. 

Then they started asking me for documents. I submitted all docs onXX/XX/XXXX and, somehow, they all disappeared and I was asked to resubmit those same documents again, sometimes 3 times. 

Lately the rates have been falling and I asked my mortgage lender about what he had told me on XX/XX/XXXX that if the rates begin to fluctuate downward, then they would move the rates downward as well. I asked a friend of mine to call NewRez as a potential customer. With a worse credit score and similar loan amount, he was quoted a quarter point lower than I was. When I asked this of XXXX XXXX, I was told that I was locked in and they could do nothing, even though that is not what he said on XX/XX/XXXXto me. 

My concern is : 1 ) I am being scammed. 
2 ) They continue to lose my documents that have my personal and security information on them. I am worried that I will be a victim of identity theft. 

Overall, if this loan ever does come through then I will save 200-250/month. But  unfortunately I feel this company is scamming me by lying about the lack of floating lock and losing all of my personal documents. 

I was also told that I would not have to pay both XX/XX/XXXX and September mortgage payment as the loan would be in place. So far I have paid XX/XX/XXXX and, if things don't move quickly, will be paying XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, since they continue to lose my documents, it is slowing the process. 

Finally, I was told I would not receive my leftover escrow back but that they would lower the loan with it. That is not on any documents that I ever received, even though I have asked them multiple times for it.",,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",MD,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3334941

They failed to tell me that they would still allow the carryover of charges ( even disputed ones ) to our new CC ( BOA failed to expedite the new CC despite our request and it took approximately one week to get a new CC ). We have numerous automatic charges so it took approximately 2 hours of my time to convert those charges to the new credit card received a week later ( New CC ). A month later the same 5 contested charges appeared on the New CC. We called XXXX  who agreed to block the charges and confirmed that these contested charges were automatically transferred by BOA. Each charge was for XXXX- apparently BOA had done NOTHING to block these charges in XX/XX/XXXX- instead they failed to tell us it was up to us to contact XXXX   to block and instead just transferred the charges despite this being the sole reason our CC was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Because the New CC number was NOT compromised- there was no reason to do more than to dispute the charges. We contacted BOA as XXXX advised we had to do and explained the situation. As explicitly discussed during the call on XX/XX/2019, the instruction was not to cancel the new number as it had NOT been compromised. We were merely disputing the charges. However, we requested reimbursement of the approximately 80.00 in disputed charges. Our call was elevated to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX in the Rhode Island CC service center who was rude and abusive on the call resulting in escalated conversations. Throughout these conversations I was explicitly clear that I would NOT be closing the New CC and Ms. XXXX confirmed this fact including at the end of the call. Ms XXXX began to raise her voice as I repeatedly asked to ask a question but her demeanor changed rapidly and she because rude and condescending as she continued. Ultimately, I was able to tell her that I dont want to fight her but that we take care of this directly with XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat those monies myself so that this wouldnt be a fraud alert because after all, my new card was never compromised. I advised that I would contact XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat the monies myself so that my New CC remain intact- as the new card was never compromised. Regardless, I was shocked by her behavior and contacted BOA to lodge a complaint into Ms. XXXX temperament and rudeness. Hours later it is abundantly clear that Ms. XXXX went back into the account and closed it. This was clearly in retaliation for the complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter. This was clearly in retaliation for my complaint.

She cancelled my New CC despite 1 ). the card itself not being compromised and 2 ). my explicit instruction not to cancel it and affirmation of this instruction by Ms. XXXX. Obviously Ms. XXXX  went ( unauthorized by me ) BACK into my New CC account and cancelled the card. The timing is very suspicious as it occurred shortly after my report of horrific customer service. Further, BOA failed to timely notify us that it had cancelled our New CC- and sitting here today, I do not know : 1 ). why it was closed despite the facts above ; 2 ). effective date of closure ; 3 ). if BOA is honoring our dispute of the XXXX charges ( not apparent in the online information ).

This violates regulatory rules and ethics rules. We did not authorize the closing of the New CC nor did we authorize a disgruntled customer service supervisor the authority to go back into our credit card account and to take action.

Both these accounts have been paid off in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in full. XXXX has a dispute that they believe I owe them money because they paid money to the cooperative that I factually informed them that I did not owe, and the money they paid them the payment states for hazard insurance in XXXX. I informed them in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not owe the cooperative any money, and XXXX stated in XX/XX/XXXX that they would not get ( see  attachment ) involved with any dispute between myself and the cooperative as the money alleged by the cooperative to be owing at the time was more than what was owed to XXXX. Furthermore one of  the loans was paid off in XXXX ( see XXXX XXXX issued by XXXX -attachment ). Furthermore, I continued to pay both loans ( which is not clear which one if not both are on the credit report as one is depicted as current but still open and the other one is depicted as 120 days late with the same account number Account # XXXX ) The account with the XX/XX/XXXX open date is the one depicted as late ( Original Balance {$14000.00} with a Balance {$50000.00} ) however both should be closed. I never entered into an agreement to extend additional credit beyond the {$14000.00} owed on the original loan and XXXX has no right to extend such or charge such additional money to the account. I never received notification for what the {$50000.00} is for either. They further have changed my address to a XXXX address which is in fact the address of their attorneys XXXX XXXX further deteriorating my credit. Based upon information and belief it is also where they have been sending all my correspondence, as I have received no correspondence from them since XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore all payments to both accounts were made monthly with one check and there can be no way that payments were not applied to both accounts simultaneously other than that XXXX has been splitting up my payments and giving them to XXXX XXXX bank which has no authority to receive or accept my payments. See attachments of checks negotiated by XXXX XXXX but sent to XXXX.

( my credit rating is above 800 ) 4. I made two phone calls to Chase to report this problem and to try to receive an explanation of how this account was opened. Chase refused to provide this information. Eventually they said not to worry and just cut up the debit card and that would be the end of it. 
5. that was an inadequate response since I am fearful that I am a victim of identity fraud. I cut up debit card and trashed the correspondence. 
6. I then received a XXXX XXXX letter saying that Chase was closing the account that I did not open because I had failed to give them information. Now I'm worried about my credit rating. 
7. By additional letter dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase informed me that they denied a charge on the account to XXXX.

Then two days before my signing date on XX/XX/XXXX, ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they told me I would be charged a 1.099 % fee because my credit scores had dropped ( three credit agencies ) from XXXX to XXXX. I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. 
First I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. 
And secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... ..
